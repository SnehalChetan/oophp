OOP - Object Orientated Programming 
 focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. 
 This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained.


## Exercise 1 : classes 

create class with public properties.
##### syntax : 

```
class ClassName {
    // properties of class
    public $name;
//constructor function 
public function __construct(string $name){
    $this->name = $name;
}
    //methods of class
    public function methodName():returntype{

    }
}
```
#### class
* Collection of properties and methods
* To access these properties and methods you need object of class

#### Object
* Object is an instance or blueprint of a class
* To create a new object a class called Instantiation.
* Or It is the process of creating an instance of an object in memory

#### Constructor
* constructor called evry time a new object of class will be created or ininitialised.
* The constructor is always of public.
* object of class created or ininitialised using `new` keyword. 
* At the same time of initialisation of object the constructor will called and execute.
* In constructor you are assigning values to the properties using `this` keyword. 
* These values pass using or while object creation.
```php
public function __construct(string $name, string $color, float $price, string $temperature = 'cold')
{
    $this->name = $name;
}
```

#### Methods
* Whatever operation you want to perform on properties you are define it in methods.
* You need to declare the datatype of a return variable at method definition.
* If a method does not return anything then you need to use `void` 

#### Accessibility or access modifier 
* It gives control over accessing properties and methods of a class. 
* Public is default modifier if not mentioned.
* Public properties and methods can be accessed from anywhere or outside the class.
* private properties and methods can ONLY be accessed within the class
* protected properties and methods can be accessed withing the class,
    and the classed derived or it's child classes.

### Exercise 1 : Classes Description
* pass a default value 'cold' to a temperature parameter. 
* So if user didn't pass a value for the temperature parameter then the default value will be assigned to it.
*Also if user pass a value for temperature parameter then the default value will not be assigned to temperature.

## Exercise 2 : Extending

### Inheritance 
* A class derives or inherit from another class.
* The child class will inherit all the public and protected properties and methods from the parent class. 
* Also the child class its own properties and methods.
* To inherit a class you need to use `extends` keyword and parent class name
```php
    class Beer extends Beverage {} 
```

### Accessing and Assigning values to parent constructor
* As child class extends or inherit the parent class it now able to access data from parent class.
* When we create the object of a child class at the same time, we need to provide values for the parent class properties and assign them by calling parent constructor in the constuctor method of child class.
    * To access the parent constructor you need to use `parent` keyword as,
```php
public function __construct($color,$price,$beerName, $alcoholPercentage)
{
    parent::__construct('beer',$color,$price);
    $this->alcoholPercentage = $alcoholPercentage;
}
```
   
### Exercise 2 : Extending Description
* Inherit the parent class Bevarage by child class Beer
* Provide all values for child and parent properties at the time of child object creation.
    `$Duvel = new Beer('blond',3.5,'duvel',8.5);`
* Create a getter method to get child class property value.
* Generate an error to understand ` parent class object can not access the child class properties as well as methods`.

## Exercise 3 : Private
* Constructor method can not be private.
* You can not access the private properties you need the public getter and setter methods.
* These methods can not be private, if though then you can not access them outside the class.

### Exercise 3 : Private Description
* Change access modifier of all properties of parent and child class from public to private.
* To access the private properties of class we need to add public getter and setter methods.
* By using these methods the child class also able to access the private properties of parent class.
* TO access the private property inside a class definition - inside method, php allows to access it as 
```php
$this->alcoholPercentage 
```
but try the same outside class definition it gives error and need getter method to access it as,
```php
$Duvel->getAlcoholPercentage(); 
```

## Exercise 4 : Protected
* The protected properties of a class can only be accessed outside by the class itself and it's direct child classes.
* Though we are using protected but still require the getter and setter methods to access the protected properties.


### Exercise 4 : Protected Description
* Change all prperties to protected and try to access them
* If you try to access protected properties you will get errors as,
>Error  :  Cannot access protected property 
* so instead 
```php
$Duvel->alcoholPercentage
    //  use 
$Duvel->getAlcoholPercentage(); 
``` 
to access it.

## Exercise 5 : Public
* Access the private properties without using getter and setter method. 
* To do that need to use the public method to assign the value to private property and return the newly changed value.

### Exercise 5 : Public Description
* Write a method to change property value
```php
    public function changePrice(float $price) : string{
        if ($price > 0){
            $this->price = $price;
            return "price of <b>".$this->price;
        }
        return 'price can\'t be negetive or 0!';
    }
```

## Exercise 6 : Const

### Class Constants
* Class constants are define within class using `const` keyword.
* These are case sensitive.
* Don't need the access modifier (public,private,protected) to declare
* Syntax of class constant variable
```php
class ClassName{
    const CONST_VARIABLE = "Het Vervolg";
}
```
* To access this constant variable, there are 3 options
    1. Access constant inside class method using `self` and `scope resolution operator (::)` as,
    ```php
     public function showConstant():string {
        return  self::CONST_VARIABLE;
    }
    ```
    call this method using same class object and child class object.
    2. Access constant outside class using `classname` and `scope resolution operator (::)` as ,
    ```php
    echo ClassName::CONST_VARIABLE;
    ```
    3. Also access by assigning classname as a value to a variable as,
    ```php
    $classname = "ClassName";
    echo $classname::CONST_VARIABLE;
    ```
* Access a parent class constant in child method using `parent` keyword and `::` as,
```php
public function getParentConstant():string{
      return  parent::CONST_VARIABLE;
   }
```
* Access the method using child class object
    
### Exercise 6 : Const Description
 * Create a const variable in a parent class and display it using parent class name.
 * Display parent class constant using child class object and method.

## Exercise 7 Static
* Declaring class properties or methods as static allow to acces them statically without needing an instantiation of the class. 
* We can not use the pseudo-variable (`$this`) inside `static methods`. Because we can access them using classname only.

### Static Properties
* To declare a static property we need to use `static` keyword
* To access static properties we don't require an class object, we can access them using the `class name` and `::`
* Use access modifiers (public, private, protected)
```php
class ClassName {
    public static $staticProperty = 'address';
}
```
* Access or Display value of a static property ouside of class as,
    1. Using class name and scope resolution operator as,
    ```php
        echo  ClassName::$staticProperty;
    ```
    2. To access static property in class method we need to use `self` keyword and call the method using class object,
    ```php
    public function getStaticProperty(){
        return self::$staticProperty;
    }
    echo $classObject->getStaticProperty();
    ```
    3. The Parent static property can be accessed using the child class name as,
    ```php
        echo ChildClassName::$staticProperty;
        //OR
        echo ChildClassName::$parentStaticProperty;
    ```
    4. To access and display parent class static property in child class method you need to use `parent` keyword as,
    ```php
        public function getParentStaticProperty(){
            return parent::$staticProperty;
        }
        echo $childObject->getParentStaticProperty();
    ```


echo "<br/><br/> Display using <b> class name variable </b> = ".$classname::$address;
echo "<br/><br/> Display using <b> child class name  </b> = ".Beer::$address;
echo "<br/><br/> Display using <b> child class method and object  </b> = ".$Duvel->getParentStaticProperty();


### Exercise 7 : Static Description
 * declare and define static property address to parent class.
 * Display this static property using parent class name and child class name
 ```php
    echo " Display Static property";
    echo "\n Using class name = ".Beverage::$address;
    echo "\n Using a simple public method and object = ".$cola->getStaticProperty();
    echo "\n Usingclass name variable = ".$classname::$address;
    echo "\n Using child class name = ".Beer::$address;
    echo "\n Using child class method and object = ".$Duvel->getParentStaticProperty(); 
```
